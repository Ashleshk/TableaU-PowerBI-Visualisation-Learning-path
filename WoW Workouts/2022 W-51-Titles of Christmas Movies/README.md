## Practice : Titles of Christmas Movies

In this challenge I learnt to break down the words used in Christmas movie titles. 
Built Word Cloud as well!! (New thing learnt)


## Requirements
   - **Power Query** (after long time revisited)
    In order to get this data in the correct format for analysis, you will need to use Power Query to shape the data.
    - **Power BI Desktop**

**Tasks**
1. Use the movie_title field
2. Use only Power Query native functions
3. Get one row per each unique word
4. First column should be unique word and second column should be count


**Reporting and Storytelling**
Now that your data is shaped appropriately, we need to display the data as a visual. 
1. Use the Microsoft Word Cloud visual found in the AppSource
2. Show each word by count
3. Feel free to add any ah-hoc analysis in!
